# Simple MD Program

* I'm developing a very basic moleculer dynamics program that can
be used for my the course I teach in the spring.

* This code borrows heavily from David Keffer's "The Working Person's 
Guide to Molecular Dynamics SImulations", although I'm writing in a different
language and plan to expand/replace certain parts of the program.

* The idea for the class is that students will start with this basic
serial version of the code and then add parallel support with PThreads,
OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, or whatever.
